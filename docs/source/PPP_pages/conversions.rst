File Conversions

As many technqiues require converions that may be computationally intensive or time consuming, we have not automated conversions in the PPP. Instead we have developed various functions to facilitate in these procedures. The PPP includes a general conversion suite - giving users access to various converions - and a specalized vcf-to-ima (i.e. IMa2/3 format) conversion function.
