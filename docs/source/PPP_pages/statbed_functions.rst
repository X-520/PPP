STAT and BED Functions
======================

The STAT and BED functions were developed to perform many optional procedures required in population genetic analyses. In particular these functions allow for sampling

of the core operations typically used in population genetic analyses. Each of these functions were designed to perform a single operation (i.e. filtering, sampling, etc.) on a BED or STAT file.
