   Introduction
   ------------

The Popgen Pipeline Platform (PPP) is a software platform with the goal of reducing the computational expertise required for conducting population genomic analyses. The PPP was designed as a collection of scripts that facilitate common population genomic workflows in a consistent and standardized environment. Functions were developed to encompass entire workflows, including: input preparation, file format conversion, various population genomic analyses, output generation, and visualization. By facilitating entire workflows, the PPP offers several benefits to prospective end users - it reduces the need of redundant in-house software and scripts that would require development time and may be error-prone, or incorrect, depending on the expertise of the investigator. The platform has also been developed with reproducibility and extensibility of analyses in mind.
